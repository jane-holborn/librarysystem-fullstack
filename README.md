# librarysystem-fullstack
🚧 Currently Under Construction 🚧

This is Version 2 of my original [LibrarySystem](https://github.com/jane-holborn/librarysystem). The first version was a basic application with no persistent data.

V2 is a full-stack upgrade, built with:

- C#
- ASP.NET Web API
- Entity Framework Core with SQLite
- WPF for the desktop front end

Current Progress:
- ✅ Basic API integration working
- ✅ Seeded data (2 users) successfully retrieved and displayed in the frontend on button click
- ✅ Reusable styling implemented with resource dictionaries in WPF 

🛠️ More features and improvements coming soon!
